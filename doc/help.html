- every Win32 object (window, menu, bitmaps, events) with a handle derives from Disposable in wtl.py
- every window derives from Window in wtl.py
  Window has the following static members which can be overridden in derived 
  classes to manipulate the appearance/behaviour of windows:

<h1>TODO</h1>

  <table>
  <tr>
  <td>_class_</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>
        _class_ws_style_ 
    _class_ws_ex_style_   
    _class_icon_  IDI_APPLICATION)
    _class_icon_sm_ = IDI_APPLICATION)
    _class_background_ = WHITE_BRUSH
    _class_style_ = 0
    _class_clip_children_and_siblings = 1
